what is your name
are you deaf
are you a student
what is your teacher's name
how do you feel
did you shower yesterday
are you hungry
did you learn sign language
are your parents deaf
please sign slower
please finger spell again
can you read lips
do you understand
good afternoon
goodbye
how are you
how are you going to arrive
I am going home
hey, whats your name
are you married
who is he
I need to brush my teeth
who hurt your feelings
where are you going to sit
the boy threw the ball
hey, what's your name
are you married
do you have children
is your dad deaf
are you divorced
how many brothers do you have
what city do you live in
do you understand him
can you drive
where is your home
what is your favorite color
are you full
do you live in a basement apartment
do you have garbage
cats like to eat birds
how do you feel
do you know how to make soup
I don't like fish
I will go to the library tomorrow
my small dog is silly and brown
I will go to the library tomorrow and borrow a new book
yes
no
I am excited
what is your age
